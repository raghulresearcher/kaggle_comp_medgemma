## Visual Sequence

### Shot 1: Product Introduction (0:00-0:15)
**On Screen:**
- MedAdhere Pro logo/title
- Tagline: "AI-Powered Medication Adherence"
- Smooth animation introducing the concept

**Voiceover:**
```
"MedAdhere Pro isn't just another reminder app. It's an autonomous 
AI care team that investigates, reasons, and acts—powered by Google's 
MedGemma medical AI."
```

### Shot 2: Architecture Diagram (0:15-0:45)
**On Screen:**
- Animated architecture diagram showing:
  - Web UI at top
  - 5 Agent boxes in middle (highlight each as mentioned)
  - MedGemma at bottom
- Arrows showing workflow between agents

**Visual Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      Patient UI         │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 Investigation Agent │ ← Highlight first
│  💡 Remediation Agent   │ ← Highlight second
│  ⚠️  Risk Agent         │ ← Highlight third
│  ⚙️  Execution Agent    │ ← Highlight fourth
│  📚 Learning Agent      │ ← Highlight fifth
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   🧠 MedGemma AI        │
│  Medical Reasoning      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Voiceover:**
```
"Five specialized agents work together:

The Investigation Agent analyzes patterns and root causes.

The Remediation Agent creates personalized solutions.

The Risk Assessment Agent validates every change with MedGemma's 
medical AI—ensuring safety.

The Execution Agent implements changes automatically.

And the Learning Agent improves the system over time."
```

### Shot 3: MedGemma Highlight (0:45-1:00)
**On Screen:**
- Zoom in on MedGemma component
- Show example prompt/response
- Highlight "Medical-Grade Accuracy"

**Example Text Overlay:**
```
MedGemma: google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it
✓ Drug interaction detection
✓ Pharmacokinetic timing
✓ Evidence-based recommendations
```

**Voiceover:**
```
"MedGemma provides medical-grade reasoning that general AI cannot—
understanding drug interactions, absorption timing, and clinical 
guidelines to keep patients safe."
```

## Production Notes

### Animations
- **Agent Boxes:** Highlight/pulse as each is mentioned
- **Arrows:** Animated flow showing data movement
- **MedGemma Zoom:** Smooth zoom transition
- **Icons:** Use consistent medical-grade iconography

### Color Coding
- **Investigation:** Blue (🔍 detective work)
- **Remediation:** Green (💡 solutions)
- **Risk Assessment:** Red/Amber (⚠️ safety)
- **Execution:** Purple (⚙️ action)
- **Learning:** Orange (📚 improvement)
- **MedGemma:** Gold/White (🧠 intelligence)

### Text Overlays
```
MedAdhere Pro
─────────────
Not Just Reminders
Medical AI Reasoning

5 Specialized Agents

## Key Messages

1. ✅ **Different from reminder apps** - Emphasize "reasoning" not "reminding"
2. ✅ **Medical-grade AI** - MedGemma's unique capabilities
3. ✅ **Autonomous system** - Agents work together without manual intervention
4. ✅ **Safety first** - Risk validation on every change
5. ✅ **Continuous improvement** - Learning agent makes system smarter

## Technical Assets Needed

### Diagrams
- [ ] Architecture diagram (PNG/SVG, 1920x1080)
- [ ] Agent workflow animation
- [ ] MedGemma integration visual

### Icons
- [ ] 5 agent icons (consistent style)
- [ ] MedGemma logo/brain icon
- [ ] Flow arrows (animated)

### Screen Recordings
- [ ] Agent dashboard/console (if available)
- [ ] Real-time agent execution visualization

---

## Transition to Scenario 1

**Visual:** Architecture diagram fades  
**New Visual:** Web UI appears (http://localhost:3000)  
**Text Overlay:** "Scenario 1: Medication Timing Conflict"  
**Voiceover:** "Let me show you how it works with Sarah's case..."

---

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Technical Deep (Current)
Show full architecture, explain each agent

### Option B: Benefit-Focused
Lead with outcomes, mention agents briefly

### Option C: Comparison
"Most apps just remind. MedAdhere Pro reasons like a doctor."

**Recommended:** Option A for competition (judges want technical depth)
