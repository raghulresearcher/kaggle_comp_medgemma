## Recording Checklist

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Review all script sections
- [ ] Ensure backend and frontend are running (ports 8000 & 3000)
- [ ] Test all 3 scenarios work end-to-end
- [ ] Prepare screen recording software (OBS Studio recommended)
- [ ] Set screen resolution to 1920x1080 for clarity
- [ ] Clear browser cache and test UI rendering
- [ ] Prepare voiceover recording setup (quiet room, good mic)

### Visual Elements Needed
- [ ] Architecture diagram (from ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] Impact metrics table (from README.md)
- [ ] Agent workflow visualization (from UI)
- [ ] MedGemma reasoning examples
- [ ] Patient journey graphics (before/after)
- [ ] Scaling projections chart

### Recording Tips
1. **Screen Recording:** Use OBS Studio or Camtasia
2. **Resolution:** 1920x1080, 60fps preferred
3. **Audio:** Record voiceover separately, sync in editing
4. **Pacing:** Speak slowly and clearly, pause between sections
5. **Transitions:** Use 1-2 second fades between sections
6. **Text Overlays:** Add key statistics and metrics on screen
7. **Mouse Movement:** Smooth, deliberate movements (use cursor highlighting)

### Post-Production
- [ ] Edit together all segments
- [ ] Add background music (subtle, professional)
- [ ] Add text overlays for key statistics
- [ ] Color grade for consistency
- [ ] Add captions/subtitles
- [ ] Export in 1080p, H.264 codec
- [ ] Upload to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted for submission)
