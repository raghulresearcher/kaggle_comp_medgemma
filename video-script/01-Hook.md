## Voiceover Script

```
[Serious, empathetic tone]

"Fifty percent of patients don't take their medications correctly, 
wasting $300 billion dollars and causing 125,000 preventable deaths 
every year.

Meet Sarah. She takes 8 medications daily, but skips her thyroid 
medication three times a week—not because she forgets, but because 
she's confused about when to take it.

What if AI could solve this?"
```

**Word Count:** 58 words  
**Timing:** 28-30 seconds at moderate pace  
**Tone:** Serious but hopeful

## Production Notes

### Audio
- **Background Music:** None or very subtle (fade in at end)
- **Sound Effects:** 
  - Subtle "thud" on each statistic
  - Soft heartbeat during statistics
  - Transition whoosh to patient story

### Visual Effects

## Key Metrics to Emphasize

✅ **50%** - Half of all patients (relatable magnitude)  
✅ **$300B** - Enormous economic waste  
✅ **125K deaths** - Human cost  
✅ **Confusion** - Not forgetfulness (shows need for AI reasoning)

## Alternative Versions

### Version A: Statistics Heavy (Current)
Focus on numbers, then patient story

### Version C: Question Lead
"What if you had an AI doctor watching over every medication dose?"

**Recommended:** Version A (statistics establish credibility first)
